Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! I am an Aerospace Engineer with a passion for designing and building things. After two years of studying Mechanical Engineering, I decided to switch to Aerospace because I wanted to work on more exciting projects. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also an avid maker and have built my own 3D printer and a 6-axis robotic arm that drives around on a chassis.

I have used GitHub extensively for personal, extracurricular, and class revision history and distribution management, including for my Technical Communication class where I used LaTeX to create my resume. Although I have not used Markdown before, I am eager to learn more about it and continue to level up my coding abilities. In my free time, I enjoy playing around with various Linux distros like Ubuntu, Raspian, PopOs, Kali, and Arch for personal projects.
