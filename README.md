### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I chose to specialize in Aerospace Engineering after taking two years of Mechanical Engineering courses and finding out that there was a 60% chance I would be working on tractors or HVAC systems for the rest of my career, so I figured a degree in Aerospace Engineering would give me a slightly better chance of finding an interesting job. Something that might be interesting to some about myself is that I have my own 3D printer, and am currently working on a 6-axis robotic arm that drives around on a chassis (like Dummy from Iron Man but smaller). I've used GitHub for personal, extracurricular, and class revision history and distribution management. The Class I've used GitHub for is Technical Communication. I have never used Markdown, but I have used LaTeX for Technical Communication and for making a resume. I've played around with various Linux distro's (Ubuntu, Raspian, PopOs, Kali, and Arch). These have been for personal projects. I'm excited to learn the difference between functional code and good code, and level up my coding ability.
